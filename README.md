# downloads_organizer
A small script that will safe you from the headache of the downloads folder. it will create a folder for all the same file, it will always run in the background and listen if there is some new files to handle.



<!-- how to install the script  -->

    
    
    ```bash
    git clone
    ```
    
    ```bash
    cd downloads_organizer
    ```
    
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    
    ```bash
    call env/Scripts/activate.bat
    ```
    
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```


    Also try to run the script in the background, figure out other solution like windows task scheduler.
