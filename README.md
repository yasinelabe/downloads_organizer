# downloads_organizer
A small script that will safe you from the headache of the downloads folder. it will create a folder for all the same file, it will always run in the background and listen if there is some new files to handle.



<!-- how to install the script  -->

    
    
    git clone https://github.com/yasinelabe/downloads_organizer.git
   
    
   
    cd downloads_organizer
    
   
    pip install -r requirements.txt
  
    
   
    call env/Scripts/activate.bat
